In Binary search we can use two method one is iterative method and second is recursive method 
in this search algorithm time complexity is O(logN).
we can apply this method only sorted order array .
<!-- low=0,high=arr.length-1
mid=low+(high-low)2

if(arr[mid]==target)
return mid
else if(target>arr[mid])
low = mid+1
else 
high=mid-1 -->
